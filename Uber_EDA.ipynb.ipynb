analysis techniques. The dataset contains information about ride requests, pickup points, trip status, and timestamps. The primary objective of this analysis is to identify patterns and reasons behind trip failures such as cancellations and unavailability of cars.\n","\n","The analysis begins with data cleaning and preprocessing. Missing values were identified in the Driver ID and Drop Timestamp columns. These missing values are meaningful, as they indicate cancelled trips or situations where cars were not available. Timestamp columns were converted into datetime format to allow time-based analysis. Additional features such as request hour and time slots were created to understand demand variations across different times of the day.\n","\n","Exploratory data analysis revealed that ride demand is highest during morning hours, followed by evening and night periods. Early morning shows comparatively lower demand. However, demand alone does not explain the problem. A significant number of trips fail due to either driver cancellations or unavailability of cars.\n","\n","Further analysis of trip status showed that a large number of requests fail because no cars are available, especially during evening and night hours. Morning hours experience a high number of cancellations, indicating driver-side issues during peak traffic hours. Pickup point analysis revealed that airport rides suffer mainly from car unavailability, while city rides face higher cancellation rates.\n","\n","A combined analysis of time slots and pickup points clearly highlights that Uber faces both time-based and location-based supply challenges. Evening and night airport rides are affected due to lack of cars, while morning city rides experience frequent cancellations. These insights indicate that the supply-demand gap is driven more by supply-side constraints rather than lack of customer demand.\n","\n","The findings of this project can help Uber improve driver allocation strategies, increase incentives during peak hours, and ensure better availability of cars at airports and during high-demand periods. This analysis provides actionable insights that can improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"},"source":["# **GitHub Link -**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"},"source":["Provide your GitHub Link here.\n","\n","GitHub Repository:\n","https://github.com/nagasai-datha/uber-supply-demand-gap-analysis\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"},"source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DpeJGUA3kjGy"},"source":["The objective of this project is to analyze Uber ride request data to identify the key factors contributing to the supply-demand gap.

These findings indicate that Uber’s supply-demand gap is driven by both time-based and location-based challenges. Addressing these issues through better driver allocation and demand forecasting can significantly improve operational efficiency and customer experience.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gIfDvo9L0UH2"},"source":["### ***Hurrah!
